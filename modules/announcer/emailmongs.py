This is an automated message. An IP address you control (${ip}) has made a POST request
to port 5000 of the ircd at ${server}. This could mean the machine at that IP
address is compromised or is doing scanning for a certain kind of vulnerable
system. Please discontinue ${ip}'s attempts to POST this network's daemons.

As this is an automated message, replies will be ignored. If you wish to email
the network staff directly, please do so to ${replymail}. Another option is to
connect with any standard irc client to ${server} and join ${helpchan}.

This email was sent at ${time} and the protocol line that triggered it was:

    ${line}

Thank you for your understanding. This message is in your inbox because ${email}
is listed as your email in a WHOIS lookup. If this is in error, please send a
full copy of this message to ${replymail} with a timestamp in GMT so a false
positive can be recorded.
