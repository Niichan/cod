### Setting up FunServ in Atheme

#### This will not work in Anope unless requested or a module is contributed

1. Add the `doc/atheme/funserv.c` file to your Atheme contrib modules folder
2. ***CHANGE THE BOT NAME THAT IS DEFINED TO MATCH YOUR COD CONFIGURATION***
3. `$ make install`
4. Load FunServ into Atheme
5. `/msg FunServ REQUESTBOT #channel`

For simplicity reasons end users will be reminded of how Quakenet's `R` service
works.
