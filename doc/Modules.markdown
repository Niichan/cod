# Modules shipped with Cod

The modules in Cod are separated into seven types:

| Type | Description |
|:---- |:----------- |
| `announcer` | Modules that listen for protocol/services events and announce them to operators. |
| `bot` | Pseudoclient commands for users. |
| `core` | Core functionality for administrators and users. |
| `experimental` | Normally untracked in git, this is a place to store local, experimental modules while they are being written until they can be comitted proper. |
| `protocol` | Protocol modules to have Cod talk over different server to server protocols. This is currently used only for the TS6 protocol handler, but is available for future expansion. |
| `scrapers` | Handles scraping PRIVMSG lines for links it can parse out and parses them, returning it to the channel. |
| `services` | Other pesudoservices that Cod introduces or handlers for Atheme/Anope integration. |

## `announcer`

#### `awayreminder`

Scans nickchanges to look for nicknames that are what some clients automatically
postpend to people marked as away, and reminds them to not use them.

#### `dnsblannounce`

***THIS MODULE ONLY WORKS WITH ELEMENTAL-IRCD BECAUSE OF A MODIFICATION IN IT MAKING DNSBL HITS GLOBAL SERVER NOTICES***

Scans the incoming server to server notices for a rejection notice because of a
DNSBL hit, then checks the offending address against many DNS blacklists, sending
the results to the services snoop channel.

Example:

```
@Cod | DNSBL:HIT: TorUser1 (TorUser1@198.96.155.3) is being disconnected due to being listed in DNS Blacklist rbl.efnetrbl.org
@Cod | Checking 198.96.155.3 in 83 blacklists...
@Cod |  + Additional information: TOR Server detected - see http://www.sectoor.de/tor.php for more information.
@Cod |  + Additional information: Blocked - see http://cbl.abuseat.org/lookup.cgi?ip=198.96.155.3
```

#### `killannounce`

Logs oper kills to the services snoop channel.

#### `prettyprint`

Logs all the channel PRIVMSG's it can see to the logfile cleanly.

#### `relayhostserv`

Relays all HostServ messages to the staff channel, automatically rejects real
domain names with a note to visit the help channel, and automatically does
vhost lookups so that opers can reject similar ones easily.

#### `resvannounce`

Announces RESV use and logs it.
